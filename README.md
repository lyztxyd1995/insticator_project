# insticator_project

This is a small questionnaire web service. I have built two servlet for users to ask questions and for administrator to mange questions, respectively.

The ip address for questions management system is :  
http://18.223.109.7:8080/insticator/admin<br>
I've already added an account with username: **yizeLiu** and password: **123**, feel free to log in and manage questions.<br>
As an administrator, you could add, edit, delete and see all questions in our system.<br>

The ip address for users' questionnaire is: <br>
http://18.223.109.7:8080/insticator/userLogin<br>
As a user, you could register an account and log in to ask questions. If you got the right answer, you will get 5 points. For objective questions, you will also get 5 points when you answer it.
